# Global-Power-Plant-Database

Problem Statement :


 The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants
 around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare
 and draw insights for one's own analysis. The database covers approximately 35,000 power 
 plants from 167 countries and inclueds thermal plants(e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, 
 biomass waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is
 geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership and
 fuel type. It will be continuously updated as data becomes available.
 
 
 In this dataset we need to make two prdictions
 
 - Fuel_Type
 - capacity_mw


 Firls we will predict capacity_mw , since the target variable "capacity_mw has continuous 
 data so it is a "Regression Problem".
 
 After that will move to Fuel_Type prediction which is "Classification Problem".
 
 The Global Power Plant DataBase is an open-source open-access dataset of grid-scale
 (1 MW and greater) electricity generating facilities operating accross the world.
 
 The actural Database currently contains nearly 35000 power plants in 167 countries, representing
 about 72% of the world's capacity. Entries are at the facility level only, generally defined as a 
 single transmission grid connection point. Generation unit-level information is not currently 
 available.
 
 But in our study we will be working on the dataset only for INDIA . The data set contains only 
 908 rows and 25 columns. The data set provides information of all the power plant situated at 
 different locations in India.
